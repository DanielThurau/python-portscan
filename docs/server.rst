Server Requirements
===================

Email
-----

The emailing module will by deafult use the localhost SMTP server, but can take an argument to direct to another. Therefore use your preferred SMTP server, and configure it to send configured emails from python3. 


PostFix is a recommended easy to use \*nix server: http://www.postfix.org

Python Version
--------------

This project uses Python 3.x.x, and is not backward compatible.

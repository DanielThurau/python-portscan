- wanting push notifications when ports are open
- large scans on hundres-of-thousands of unique IP's
- keeping a record of how ports open/close

portscan modules
---------------

The lib currently offers the following modules:

- **businessunit**: backbone object that owns scanobject, reads config files, constructs data, performs the scanning, and parses data.
- ** scanobject**: encapsualates data parsed by businessunit and serves it during scanning.
- **email**: enables users to send push notifications to users from data collected by businessunit.
- **htmlgenerator**: enables users to programmatically generate HTML reports from data collected.
- **log**: custom log generator object.
- **upload**: enables users to upload and share links to reports generated by businessunit objects.
